- 👋 Hi, I'm Gleb Kartashov
- 👀 I’m interested in math
- Trying to choose between Python (ML) and Java/C#
- Also I know a little C++ (for sport programming) and Python
- Now I'm want to get to Moscow universities like МФТИ, ВШЭ, МГТУ, МАИ, МЭИ, МИСИС, it's why I should prepare to pass the EGE (rus, math, phys, inf) and prepare to school olimpiads (math, inf and maybe phys, rus)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing (in programming) :)
- ~~💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects~~
